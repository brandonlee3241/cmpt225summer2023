 - [singly_linked_list3.cpp](singly_linked_list3.cpp) shows how to implement
   some more methods for the `List` class, such as `contains(s)` and
   `reverse()`.
   [singly_linked_list3_recursive.cpp](singly_linked_list3_recursive.cpp) shows
   to recursion in place of loops to implement many of the methods.
